# Privacy Policy for Atom2Universe

**Last updated: January 20, 2025**

## Overview

Atom2Universe is an ever-growing Android app built around many different modules. At its core is an atom clicker where you start with a single atom and collect more to fill your universe — alongside a music player, MIDI player, internet radio, audio editor, games, and more. This Privacy Policy explains how Atom2Universe handles your data.

**In short: Atom2Universe does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All your data stays on your device and optionally on your personal Google Drive account.**

## Data Collection

### What We DO NOT Collect

- No personal information (name, email, phone number)
- No usage analytics or tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No location data
- No device identifiers sent to external servers
- No crash reports sent to external services

### What Stays On Your Device

Atom2Universe stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Music library metadata**: Artist, album, track information scanned from your audio files
- **MIDI library**: MIDI files you add to your library
- **Playlists and favorites**: Your custom playlists and favorite tracks
- **Play counts**: How many times you've played each track
- **App settings**: Your preferences (theme, synthesizer settings, etc.)
- **Radio recordings**: Audio files you record from internet radio streams (saved to your device's Music folder)

This data is stored in local databases and files on your device. It is never transmitted to any external server.

## Google Drive Sync (Optional Feature)

Atom2Universe offers an **optional** Google Drive synchronization feature to backup and sync your favorites and playlists across devices.

### How It Works

- Uses Google Sign-In with OAuth 2.0
- Stores data in your **private app folder** on Google Drive (`appDataFolder` scope)
- Only Atom2Universe can access this folder - it's hidden from your regular Drive files
- No other apps or services can read this data

### What Is Synced

- Favorite tracks list
- Playlist data
- Play counts

### What Is NOT Synced

- Your actual audio/MIDI files
- Radio recordings
- App settings

### Your Control

- You can enable or disable sync at any time in the app settings
- You can delete your cloud data using the "Delete cloud data" option in the app
- You can revoke access via your [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- Deleting the app removes local data; use the in-app option to delete cloud data before uninstalling

## Internet Radio

When using the internet radio feature:

- Atom2Universe connects directly to radio station streams you select
- Station searches use the public [Radio Browser API](https://www.radio-browser.info/)
- No personal data is sent to radio stations or the Radio Browser API
- Radio recordings are stored locally on your device

## Lyrics Feature

The lyrics feature may fetch song lyrics from external sources:

- Lyrics are fetched on-demand when you request them
- No personal data is sent with lyrics requests
- Only song title and artist name are used for searching
