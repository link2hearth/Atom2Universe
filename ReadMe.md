# Atom to Universe 🌌

*A science-themed idle clicker born from curiosity, AI, and joyful experimentation.*

## 🧪 Project Origin

In August, after watching the presentation of ChatGPT Codex, a simple idea crossed my mind:

> *“What if I could make a game too?”*

I had never read or written a single line of code.

In September, I subscribed to ChatGPT with a very naïve goal: to try.
I quickly realized that making a “real” game with an engine like Godot or Unreal would require far more knowledge than I had.
On the other hand, ChatGPT really loved suggesting… HTML pages.

Fate was sealed: this would be a **web game**.

## ⚛️ The Concept

**Atom to Universe** is an **idle clicker / incremental game** focused on science and extremely large numbers.

The goal is simple, almost absurd:
👉 collect atoms
👉 collect more atoms
👉 until you reach quantities comparable to those of the observable universe

Because… why not?

## 🎰 The (Free) Gacha System

I like gacha games…
but I like them a lot less when they cost a fortune.

In Atom to Universe, the gacha system is **100% free** and is used to collect the **118 elements of the periodic table**.
No pressure, no payments — just the joy of completing a scientific collection.

## 🕹️ Mini-games and Content

As development progressed (and as I kept asking ChatGPT for things), the project became an experimental playground.

You’ll find, among other things:

* classic mini-games

  * chess
  * solitaire
  * match-3
  * brick breaker
  * shoot ’em up
  * 2048

* more original mini-games, best discovered directly in the game

* “outside-the-game” modules, because why stop there:

  * a full MIDI player
  * a virtual keyboard to play piano notes
  * a radio module
  * a crypto module (Bitcoin, Ethereum…)
  * a Notes module with `.txt` file saving
  * a system to display your favorite images on the main page

Yes, it’s a joyful mess.
And that’s entirely intentional.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

Atom to Universe is everything:

* an **AI-assisted creative experiment**
* a demonstration of what someone with no programming knowledge can build
* a sandbox where curiosity > optimization
* a tribute to idle games, mini-games, and science

I barely understand any line of code in this project.
And yet, it works.

## 🚧 Project Status

The project is:

* under constant development
* experimental by nature
* sometimes clumsy
* often surprising

It is not meant to be “clean” or “optimized” in an industrial sense.

---

## ⚠️ Honest Disclaimer

* The code is generated with the help of ChatGPT CODEX
* The structure may be unusual, even though I did my best to keep things organized
* Some features exist mostly because “Why not?”

This repository is as much a **game** as it is a **digital curiosity journal**.

---

## 🤖 Tools Used

* ChatGPT (OpenAI)
* HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no heavy frameworks) and some Java/Kotlin for Android
* Lots of trial and error, and plenty of strange ideas

## 📜 License

To be defined.
The project is open to curiosity, exploration, and inspiration.
